If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
wait Camillo say means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves; for indeed--
wait Camillo say Beseech you,--
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
us.
wait Camillo say You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
wait Camillo say winds. The heavens continue their loves!
I think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into my note.
wait Camillo say see him a man.
Would they else be content to die?
wait Camillo say desire to live.
If the king had no son, they would desire to live
on crutches till he had one.
